            class="c1"><span class="c0">Pasta Factory is a simulation of a pasta
                cutting machine splitting dough into individual noodles.
                Components of the machine are interactive via the GUI, such as
                the motion of the conveyor belt and the rendering/motion of the
                slicer&rsquo;s individual blades. To summarize the process of
                pasta cutting:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span
                class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the
                pasta dough, modeled as a cloth, falls onto the conveyor belt,
                we keep the dough moving by applying velocity onto the object
                anytime there is a collision with the belt. Then, when the dough
                passes through the slicer, blades descend (triggered through key
                press) to chop up the dough by splitting the cloth. The noodles
                formed or new cloths are then moved off the conveyor belt into a
                bowl. </span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.krpjdfj2kp0v"><span
                class="c10">Technical Approach</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>We
                used project 4 as our main reference point. </span></p><h2
            class="c7" id="h.poetasj84pmy"><span class="c8">Creating and
                rendering collision objects</span></h2><p class="c1"><span
                class="c0">We want to create various shapes in the scene for our
                pasta cutting machine. We initially considered creating Collada
                files with Blender. Upon realizing our baseline Clothsim code
                does not innately have infrastructure to accommodate Collada
                files, we sidelined the idea to make a custom .dae parser to
                first explore if we could manipulate existing plane and sphere
                rendering/collision code. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span
                class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In
                Clothsim, we are given the plane.cpp, which spans the whole
                plane. To carve out specific shapes from a plane, we implemented
                a &ldquo;manual render&rdquo; mode in plane.cpp. When manual
                render is toggled on, we can manually specify how much of the
                plane should be rendered and how much of the plane consists of a
                valid collision surface. In order to do this, we specify the 4
                corners of the polygon we want to render. Compound shapes
                composed of several adjacent planes, like cubes (i.e. the
                slicing box), are anchored to a centroid and the corners of each
                face are bound by a specified distance from the centroid.
            </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p
            class="c1"><span class="c0">For collision detection, we first check
                that a point mass has crossed over the plane between timesteps
                (like in homework 4), and then we check that the projection of
                this point onto the plane lies in the four half-spaces formed by
                the four edges of the polygon. One caveat is that this only
                works for convex polygons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span
                class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c7"
            id="h.ix3p2wy1wxf"><span>Global Collisions</span></h2><p
            class="c1"><span class="c0">Because we have multiple cloths
                (multiple pasta noodles), we needed to implement global
                collisions. The first step in this process was adding the
                ability to add multiple cloths and also adjusting the initial
                positions of cloths. In order to do this, we modified
                main.cpp&rsquo;s loadobjectsfromfile to parse new parameters for
                the cloths.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span
                class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, we
                moved the collision functions for point masses to
                clothSimulator.cpp (where before it was in cloth.cpp). This is
                the equivalent of making cloth collisions global so that now it
                is being handled in clothsimulator.cpp. </span></p><p
            class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span
                class="c0">Thus, in the simulate loop, at every time step we do
                the following: First, we go through every cloth and then
                simulate the acceleration on all the pointmasses. Then we hash
                all the pointmasses into a global hashmap. Then, we check each
                bucket to model collisions and apply correction vectors. This
                works because self-collisions (collisions of point masses of the
                same cloth) and pointmass-to-pointmass collisions of different
                cloths can be modeled in an identical manner. </span></p><p
            class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span
                class="c0">We were worried that this would be computationally
                expensive, but this scales with the amount point masses and how
                densely they are packed. Since the amount of noodles does not
                affect how quickly we can simulate global collisions, we are not
                worried about computational complexity.</span></p><h2 class="c7"
            id="h.9prh1iw9r5xp"><span class="c8">Conveyor belt</span></h2><p
            class="c1"><span>Originally we planned to simulate the conveyor belt
                as a connected cloth rotating on rollers. However, we did not
                have time to reach this stretch goal. As a proxy, we used a long
                rectangle cut out from the plane. In order to simulate the
                conveyor belt moving pointmasses, we modified the correction
                vectors applied to the </span><span>point masses</span><span
                class="c0">. By adding a directional vector, it simulates
                movement.</span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.43wrbt9ncu9i"><span
                class="c8">Slicing the pasta</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>An
                initial approach we considered was performing spring collision
                detection. If a slicer made contact with a spring, it would
                simply delete the spring. However, we realized that deleting a
                spring would not be sufficient, as certain functions like
                buildClothMesh rely on point masses. Therefore, although there
                would no longer be a spring that connects 2 point masses, their
                mesh would still be connected. As a result, it would still be
                rendered as connected if we were to turn on Phong or texture
                shading. This is also why cutting the cloth only partially would
                not work, as the cloth would still look connected.</span></p><p
            class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span
                class="c0">Slicing the pasta can be broken down into several
                parts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p
            class="c1"><span class="c0">In the GUI, the user is able to select
                the number of slicers as well as adjust the height of these
                slicers. In order to slice the cloth, we check for collisions by
                calculating the slicers height relative to the cloth. If the
                slicer makes contact with the cloth, we store this
                slicer&rsquo;s x-position in a set, which we use to perform the
                actual slicing of the cloth. We checked if the slicer makes
                contact with the cloth by checking if the nearest
                pointmass&rsquo;s coordinates are close to or equal to the
                slicer&rsquo;s coordinates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span
                class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The slicing function
                takes in a cloth and a set of x-coordinates that we use to slice
                it. Slicing can be thought of as sorting point masses into
                buckets based on the boundaries of the box and the set of
                x-coordinates we are given. For example, if our box ranges from
                0 to 1 and we are provided x-coordinates of 0.2 and 0.4. We will
                split point masses into 3 buckets: [0, 0.2), [0.2, 0.4), and
                [0.4, 1]. Once we sort these point masses into buckets, we call
                a function that creates a new cloth given the </span><span>point
                masses</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in each bucket, building new
                springs and mesh and updating each cloth&rsquo;s dimensions as
                needed. Finally, we delete the original cloth.</span></p><p
            class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>From
                here, we simply push these new </span><span>cloths</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;into our cloth_objects vector to ensure that
                the rest of the simulation will reflect these
                changes.</span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.l3ul6m9wirmb"><span
                class="c8">Pasta Bowl</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>To make the
                pasta bowl, we created a hemisphere, heavily based on
                sphere.cpp. We needed to update three parts: rendering,
                collisions, and lighting. In order to render just half the
                sphere, we iterated over the latitude and half the longitude.
                This rendered the bottom half of the sphere, which looks like a
                bowl. Collisions for the sphere now work from the inside, and it
                detects whether or not a point mass has passed through the
                inside of the sphere. If it has, then a correction vector is
                applied, moving the point back inside of the sphere. This vector
                is based on the origin of the sphere to the point&rsquo;s
                position, effectively calculating the tangent point on the
                sphere. Finally, we inverted the normals and lighting intensity
                of the sphere in order to light the bowl better; before, the
                inside of the bowl was completely dark.</span></p><p

            id="h.j0l3nrnc7df"><span class="c8">Interactivity</span></h2><p
            class="c1"><span>To make the simulation interactive, we created key
                commands and sliders on the screen that the users can engage
                with. Similar to homework 4, &lsquo;p&rsquo; will start and stop
                the simulation. We added the key &lsquo;b&rsquo; to enable the
                starting and stopping of the conveyor belt, which will allow
                objects on it to move or not. Next up, we added two things to
                the GUI: a &ldquo;slicer(s)&rdquo; panel and &ldquo;slicer
                height&rdquo; slider. The &ldquo;slicer(s)&rdquo; ranges from
                0-7 allowing the user to choose how many pasta slicers to
                include in the simulation. The &ldquo;slicer height&rdquo;
                slider allows users to control how the slicers move (up and
                down) and determine when to cut the pasta.</span></p><h1
